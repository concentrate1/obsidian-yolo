/**
 * Per-file anchored prefix cache for the voice-input polish prompt.
 *
 * Why this exists:
 *   The naive way to assemble `<cursor_before>` is "the last N characters
 *   of the text before the cursor". That makes the slice's START byte move
 *   forward whenever the user inserts content — and most provider prefix
 *   caches (OpenAI / DeepSeek automatic, Anthropic `cache_control`) only
 *   hit when the leading bytes of the prompt are IDENTICAL across calls.
 *   So the naive sliding window misses cache on every polish.
 *
 * Strategy:
 *   - Anchor `prefixStart` to a FIXED document offset chosen at the start
 *     of a dictation arc (or the last re-anchor).
 *   - On subsequent polishes within the same file, return
 *     `doc.slice(prefixStart, cursor)` — the slice grows only at the TAIL
 *     as the user writes / accepts text, leaving the leading bytes (and
 *     the upstream prompt cache) untouched.
 *   - The user-facing before-cursor window is the INITIAL anchored length.
 *     The returned slice can then grow naturally as dictation inserts text
 *     after the anchor. `maxPrefixChars` is only the internal safety cap that
 *     forces a re-anchor when the prefix has grown too large.
 *   - Keep MULTIPLE anchors per file (LRU, default 4 slots). When the user
 *     jumps to a remote region and later returns, the original region's
 *     anchor is still cached — the upstream prompt cache hits again instead
 *     of cold-starting. A single anchor would get evicted by the first
 *     "long jump", losing all benefit on the return trip.
 *   - On `pickBeforeSlice`, pick the legal anchor with the SMALLEST
 *     `prefixStart` (longest slice = longest cacheable prefix); if no
 *     anchor is legal, create a new one and LRU-evict the oldest.
 *   - An anchor is "legal" iff:
 *       a) cursor >= anchor.prefixStart   (didn't jump up past it)
 *       b) cursor - anchor.prefixStart <= maxPrefixChars   (slice within cap)
 *       c) bytes at prefixStart still match the cached anchor bytes
 *          (no edits at or before the anchor offset)
 *
 * The after-cursor window is NOT cached. It's short (default 600 chars)
 * and shifts with every cursor move; the bookkeeping cost outweighs the
 * cache benefit.
 *
 * Storage is in-memory, keyed by file path. Never persisted. Use
 * `forget(path)` on file/folder rename / delete and `clear()` on plugin
 * teardown.

/**
 * Width of the "anchor window" — the bytes at the anchor we sample to
 * detect that the document has shifted at or before our anchor offset.
 *
 * Two reasons this is small and not the full cached region:
 *
 * 1. **Deliberate tolerance for mid-slice edits.** When the user edits the
 *    middle of the cached region (past the anchor window), we don't notice,
 *    and we keep using the existing anchor. The upstream prompt cache then
 *    partially hits (the common prefix up to the edit point). If we DID
 *    detect mid-slice edits and re-anchored, the new slice would be
 *    completely fresh content — upstream cache drops back to system+meta
 *    only. So this is a feature, not a perf hack.
 *
 * 2. The CPU cost of comparing the full 8000-char cached region every
 *    polish is negligible in modern browsers (~16 µs per call per a 50KB-doc
 *    microbenchmark). 256 chosen here was not for performance.
 *
 * Any insert/delete *at or before* the anchor offset shifts the bytes at
 * `prefixStart` — even a 1-char delta would change the window content.
 * 256 is comfortably above the minimum needed for unambiguous detection.

//    way.
//  - Saving the original bytes is what we actually mean: "is the doc still
//    the same at this offset?". The hash was an obfuscation of that.
//  - When the anchor sits near the cursor, the first window may be shorter
//    than 256 chars. Later typing extends the document tail, so compare only
//    the originally captured length; otherwise a stable anchor would miss
//    just because more text now exists after it.
//
// Memory cost: 256 chars × slotsPerFile (4) × N files ≈ 100KB at 100 cached
// files. Negligible.
